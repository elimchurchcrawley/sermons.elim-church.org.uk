  * [Shape-shifting cryptominer savaging Linux endpoints and IoT](https://www.theregister.com/2022/09/10/in_brief_security/ "Shape-shifting cryptominer savaging Linux endpoints and IoT") — The malware was dubbed "Shikitega" for its extensive use of the popular Shikata Ga Nai polymorphic encoder, which allows the malware to "mutate" its code to avoid detection. Shikitega alters its code each time it runs through one of several decoding loops that AT&T said each deliver multiple attacks, beginning with an ELF file that's just 370 bytes.
